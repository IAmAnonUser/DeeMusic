### Queue Integration Architecture

```
Library Scanner ‚Üí Queue Integration ‚Üí DeeMusic Queue
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                ‚Üì
1. Select Albums    2. Convert Format   3. Add to Queue
2. User Interface   3. Save to File     4. Ready for Download
```

### File Locations

- **DeeMusic Queue**: `%APPDATA%/DeeMusic/download_queue_state.json`
- **Library Scanner Cache**: `DeeMusicLibraryScanner/download_queue.json`
- **Scan Results**: `%APPDATA%/DeeMusic/library_scan_results.json`

### Queue Data Format

Albums are added to DeeMusic's queue with the following information:
```json
{
  "id": "123456",
  "type": "album",
  "title": "Album Title",
  "artist": "Artist Name",
  "year": 2023,
  "track_count": 12,
  "url": "https://www.deezer.com/album/123456",
  "status": "pending",
  "added_at": "2025-07-16T08:28:16.115100",
  "source": "Library Scanner",
  "local_album_path": "/path/to/local/album",
  "missing_tracks_count": 5,
  "priority": "normal"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "DeeMusic queue not accessible"
**Solution**: Run DeeMusic at least once to create the queue directory structure.

### ‚ùå "No albums selected for import"
**Solution**: Use the checkboxes in the Missing Albums view to select albums before importing.

### ‚ùå "Import failed"
**Possible causes**:
- DeeMusic is currently running and has the queue file locked
- Insufficient disk space
- Permission issues with AppData directory

**Solutions**:
- Close DeeMusic before importing
- Check available disk space
- Run as administrator if needed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è "Some albums already in queue"
This is normal - the system prevents duplicate imports automatically.

## Best Practices

### üéØ **Efficient Workflow**
1. **Batch Processing**: Select multiple albums at once for efficient importing
2. **Regular Updates**: Use "Update Scan" and "Update Fast Comparison" for new music
