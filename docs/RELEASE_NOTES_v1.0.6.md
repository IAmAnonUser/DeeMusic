# DeeMusic v1.0.6 Release Notes
*Released: July 26, 2025*

## üéØ Major Track Number Fix

### The Problem
One of the most critical issues in DeeMusic was that **all album tracks were showing "01"** in their filenames instead of the correct sequential track numbers (01, 02, 03, etc.). This made album organization confusing and unprofessional.

### The Solution
We've completely resolved this issue with a comprehensive fix that addresses the root cause in the Deezer API integration:

#### ‚úÖ **Correct Track Numbering**
- **Track 1** now shows as `01` ‚úÖ
- **Track 2** now shows as `02` ‚úÖ  
- **Track 3** now shows as `03` ‚úÖ
- And so on for all tracks in the album

#### üîß **Technical Implementation**
1. **Fixed API Field Mapping**: Changed from incorrect `TRACK_POSITION` to correct `SNG_TRACK_NUMBER`
2. **Enhanced Download Logic**: Modified download worker to always fetch detailed track info for album tracks
3. **Added Type Conversion**: Proper integer conversion for track number fields
4. **Improved Fallback Chain**: `SNG_TRACK_NUMBER` ‚Üí `TRACK_POSITION` ‚Üí `POSITION` ‚Üí default to 1
5. **Ensured Consistency**: `track_position` always matches `track_number`

#### üìÅ **Before vs After**
```
BEFORE (All tracks showed 01):
01 - Artist - Track One.mp3
01 - Artist - Track Two.mp3
01 - Artist - Track Three.mp3

AFTER (Correct sequential numbering):
01 - Artist - Track One.mp3
02 - Artist - Track Two.mp3
03 - Artist - Track Three.mp3
```

## üîß Download Queue Improvements

### üóëÔ∏è **New "Clear Pending" Button**
Added a dedicated button to resolve the frustrating issue where downloads would get stuck as "Pending" even after completion.

#### **The Problem**
- Users would download albums but close the app without clearing the queue
- Albums would appear as "Pending Downloads" on restart
- Even though files were downloaded, they couldn't be removed from the UI
- The `download_queue_state.json` would show empty arrays but UI still showed pending items

#### **The Solution**
- **New Button**: "Clear Pending" button specifically for stuck downloads
- **Smart Detection**: Improved album completion detection with enhanced logging
- **Targeted Cleanup**: Only clears stuck pending downloads without affecting active downloads
- **Better UI Refresh**: Queue state management ensures UI properly refreshes after operations

#### **Three-Button Layout**
- **"Clear All"**: Clears everything (active, completed, failed, pending)
- **"Clear Pending"**: Clears only stuck pending downloads from previous sessions
- **"Clear Completed"**: Clears only completed downloads
