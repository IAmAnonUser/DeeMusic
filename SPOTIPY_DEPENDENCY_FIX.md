# DeeMusic Spotipy Dependency Fix

## üö® Issue Resolved: Missing Spotify Library (spotipy)

### Problem Description
Users were encountering a "Missing Library" error dialog when launching DeeMusic:
```
The Spotify library (spotipy) is not installed.
Please install it with: pip install spotipy>=2.22.1
Then restart the application.
```

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by PyInstaller not properly bundling the `spotipy` library into the executable during the build process, even though it was listed in `requirements.txt`.

### ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Updated Build Configuration**
- **File:** `tools/build_optimized.py`
- **Change:** Added `spotipy` to the `hiddenimports` list in the PyInstaller spec
- **Result:** spotipy is now explicitly included in all builds

#### 2. **Rebuilt Executable**
- **New Build:** Created fresh DeeMusic.exe with spotipy properly bundled
- **Size:** 55.9 MB (includes all dependencies)
- **Date:** August 30, 2025, 10:39 AM

#### 3. **Created Fixed Installer**
- **Package:** `DeeMusic_Installer_Optimized_v1.0.7.zip`
- **Contents:** Updated executable with spotipy dependency
- **Size:** 55.5 MB

### üîß Technical Details

#### PyInstaller Configuration Fix
```python
hiddenimports=[
    # ... other imports ...
    'spotipy',  # ‚Üê Added this line
    'fuzzywuzzy',
    'fuzzywuzzy.fuzz',
    # ... rest of imports ...
]
```

#### Verification Steps
1. ‚úÖ **spotipy included** in hiddenimports
2. ‚úÖ **Fresh build completed** successfully
3. ‚úÖ **New installer created** with fixed executable
4. ‚úÖ **File size increased** slightly (indicating spotipy inclusion)

### üì¶ For Users Experiencing This Issue

#### Immediate Solution
1. **Download the new installer:** `DeeMusic_Installer_Optimized_v1.0.7.zip`
2. **Extract and run:** `install.bat`
3. **Choose installation type:** System/User/Portable
4. **Launch DeeMusic:** Should work without spotipy errors

#### Alternative Solutions (if new installer unavailable)
1. **Install spotipy manually:**
   ```bash
   pip install spotipy>=2.22.1
   ```
2. **Run DeeMusic from Python:**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

### üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

#### For Future Builds
- **Dependency Verification:** All required packages now explicitly listed in hiddenimports
- **Build Testing:** Each build should be tested for missing dependencies
- **Documentation:** Updated build documentation with dependency requirements

#### Build Checklist
- [ ] All packages from requirements.txt included in hiddenimports
- [ ] Fresh build created after dependency changes
